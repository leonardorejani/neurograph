> **neurograph** ships the anatomy as data: a public domain lateral illustration was traced with marching squares and simplified to 10KB of polylines, so the component draws a real cortex with no image request, no WebGL and no dependencies.

## What it is

```yaml
product:   animated brain network for hero sections and backgrounds
runtime:   plain canvas 2D, no WebGL, no build step, about 25KB
anatomy:   1 outline + 52 sulci traced from a public domain illustration, about 10KB of points
placement: nodes born on the sulci at constant arc length, each held by a spring
modes:     brain · globe · free field
use with:  plain HTML · React · Next.js (use client included)
a11y:      honours prefers-reduced-motion with a single static frame
license:   MIT
```

<!-- /readme-padrao:header -->

Every "particles with lines" background draws the same floating cloud. neurograph
draws a **brain**: the silhouette, the cerebellum, the brain stem and 52 real sulci
come from a public-domain anatomical illustration, converted into geometry the
component ships with. Most of the nodes are born **on the folds**, so the network
traces the cortex instead of hovering in a rectangle.

No build step. No dependencies. No image requests. One canvas.

## The honest part first

| What it is | What it is not |
| --- | --- |
| A 2D canvas effect with real anatomical geometry baked in | A 3D brain model, an MRI viewer or a neuroscience tool |
| One lateral (side) view, mirrorable with `flip` | Multiple angles, rotation or slices of a brain |
| A decorative hero / background element | A data visualization: the links mean nothing |
| ~25KB of JS, no assets to fetch | Free at any node count, see [Performance](#performance) |

The sulci are anatomically placed, but this is art direction, not science. If you
need a real brain atlas, look at [Netron](https://netron.app) or a proper
neuroimaging stack instead.

---

## Quick start

### Zero install

Double-click **`index.html`**. It is fully self-contained: no Node, no server, no
internet. Full control panel included.

### React / Next.js

Copy `src/` into your project:

```jsx
import Neurograph from "./neurograph/Neurograph.jsx";

export default function Hero() {
  return (
    <div style={{ position: "relative", height: "100vh" }}>
      <Neurograph count={1100} followSulci={0.6} colorA="#22d3ee" colorB="#a855f7" />
      <h1 style={{ position: "absolute", inset: 0, display: "grid", placeContent: "center" }}>
        Your headline
      </h1>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The canvas fills 100% of its parent, so **give the parent a height**. The file
already starts with `"use client"` for the Next.js app router.

Prefer a single file? `src/Neurograph.standalone.jsx` is the whole thing, engine
and geometry included, with the same props.

### Plain JavaScript

```js
import { createNeurograph } from "./neurograph/neurograph.js";

const brain = createNeurograph(document.querySelector("#canvas"), {
  count: 1100,
  colorA: "#34d399",
  colorB: "#0ea5e9",
});

brain.update({ anatomy: 0 });  // hide the outline, keep only the network
brain.stop();                  // pause, e.g. when it leaves the viewport
brain.destroy();               // remove listeners and cancel the RAF loop
```

`src/neurograph.js` is an ES module, so `<script type="module">` needs to be
served over http (Chrome blocks modules on `file://`). From the repo root:

```bash
npx serve .              # then open http://localhost:3000/examples/vanilla/
python3 -m http.server   # or http://localhost:8000/examples/vanilla/
```

---

## See it

```bash
open index.html          # double-click works too
```

`index.html` inlines everything, so there are no relative-path or CORS gotchas.
`examples/vanilla/` is the same thing wired the "real" way, importing from `src/`.
`examples/vite-react/` is a working React app:

```bash
cd examples/vite-react && npm install && npm run dev
```

## Where the anatomy comes from

The shape is not hand-drawn and it is not an SVG the component fetches at runtime.
A public-domain lateral illustration was rasterized and turned into polylines:

1. rasterize at 900px wide;
2. binary mask from alpha + luminance, with a flood fill from the borders to close
   interior holes;
3. **marching squares** to trace contours;
4. **Douglas-Peucker** simplification (ε ≈ 1.6px for the outline, 1.9px for the sulci);
5. normalize to integers `0..1000` relative to the brain width.

![from public-domain illustration to shipped geometry](assets/extraction.webp)

The result is 1 outer contour (87 points, including cerebellum and brain stem)
plus 52 sulci polylines (~1180 points): about 10KB of numbers, embedded in the
module as `BRAIN_SHAPE`.

Two details make it read as a brain instead of noise:

- **Constant arc-length spacing.** Nodes on the sulci are spaced by distance along
  each fold, not sampled at random. Without it the cerebellum, which is densely
  hatched, swallows almost every node.
- **Anchored nodes.** Every node orbits the point where it was born, held by a
  spring (`cohesion`). It breathes, but it never dissolves the anatomy.

Turn the outline off entirely with `anatomy: 0` and the brain is still perfectly
readable, drawn only by the nodes:

## Options

| Option | Type | Default | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `shape` | `'brain' \| 'network' \| 'globe'` | `'brain'` | anatomical silhouette, free field or spinning sphere |
| `count` | number | `1100` | number of nodes |
| `linkDistance` | number | `46` | max connection distance, in px |
| `followSulci` | 0..1 | `0.6` | share of nodes born **on the real sulci** |
| `cohesion` | 0..1 | `0.35` | spring holding each node near its anchor |
| `speed` | 0..2 | `0.45` | overall speed |
| `pulses` | number | `26` | synapses travelling at the same time |
| `glow` | 0..1 | `0.55` | glow strength |
| `anatomy` | 0..1 | `0.28` | outline + sulci opacity (`0` = network only) |
| `colorA` / `colorB` | hex | `#22d3ee` / `#a855f7` | gradient endpoints |
| `interactive` | boolean | `true` | mouse repulsion + click wave |
| `flip` | boolean | `false` | mirror the brain horizontally |
| `maxDpr` | number | `2` | devicePixelRatio ceiling |
| `respectReducedMotion` | boolean | `true` | render a single static frame under `prefers-reduced-motion` |

Changing `shape`, `count`, `followSulci` or `flip` rebuilds the node set.
Everything else applies on the next frame, without rebuilding anything.

## JavaScript API

```js
const brain = createNeurograph(canvas, options);

brain.update({ colorA: "#f472b6" });  // runtime options, rebuilds only if needed
brain.rebuild();                      // force a full rebuild
brain.stop();                         // cancel the animation frame loop
brain.start();                        // resume
brain.options;                        // current resolved options
brain.nodeCount;                      // nodes actually placed
brain.destroy();                      // listeners + RAF cleanup
```

TypeScript definitions live in [`src/neurograph.d.ts`](src/neurograph.d.ts).

## Other shapes

The same engine ships two non-anatomical modes, for when you want the look without
the brain.

<tr>
<td width="50%"><img src="assets/globe.webp" alt="globe mode: nodes on a slowly rotating sphere" /></td>
<td width="50%"><img src="assets/free-field.webp" alt="free field mode: a classic connected-particles background" /></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center"><code>shape: "globe"</code></td>
<td align="center"><code>shape: "network"</code></td>
</tr>
</table>

## Performance

- Links go through a **spatial grid**, not O(n²). 1100 nodes hold 60fps
  comfortably; ~1600 is a sane ceiling on a normal machine.
- `devicePixelRatio` is capped at 2 (`maxDpr`) so 3x displays don't quadruple the
  fill cost.
- Links are batched into a handful of `Path2D` objects (one per tone/alpha bucket)
  and stroked once each, instead of one `stroke()` per link. That cut the JS time
  per frame 3-6x.
- Node glow is a pre-rendered radial-gradient sprite drawn with `drawImage`, not
  `shadowBlur`. Shadowed arcs by the hundred fall on the slow raster path and hold
  the frame rate at 6-20fps even when the JS callback is cheap; the sprite keeps
  the look and lets the frame run at 60fps. `shadowBlur` is only used on the few
  pulses.
- Drawing is capped at ~60fps on 120Hz displays. Motion is per frame, not per
  `dt`, so this also keeps the speed the same on both.
- The brain mode calls `isPointInPath` per node per frame to keep nodes inside the
  silhouette. Measured, it is cheap (~0.5us per call); lower `count` before
  anything else if you still need headroom.
- Call `brain.stop()` when the element leaves the viewport (`IntersectionObserver`)
  if you care about battery.
- `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` renders one static frame and stops. It still
  looks like a brain.

## Swap the shape

`BRAIN_SHAPE` is just `{ aspect, outline: string[], sulci: string[] }`, where each
string is `"x y x y x y ..."` in integers `0..1000` (x normalized by width, y on
the same scale). Swap it for a front view, a top view, or your own logo, and the
whole engine keeps working.
